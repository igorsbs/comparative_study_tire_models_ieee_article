Files to generate the article results

To reproduce the results presented in the article, it is necessary to run the script file Run_simulation.m, which automates the execution of the simulations. Additionally, specific Simulink files, .mat files, and MATLAB functions are required as they contain the models, data, and configurations used in the simulations.

However, due to confidentiality constraints related to the project, these files have not been made publicly available. If you require access to these files for academic or research purposes, please contact us directly to request them.
