# comparative_study_tire_models_ieee_article

To reproduce the results presented in the article, it is necessary to run the generate_results.p script in MATLAB.

This script operates based on maneuver input data obtained from the VI-CRT software and uses it to run the vehicle model developed in MATLAB. The program then generates the results for the side slip angle and yaw rate.

In addition to this, the script also outputs the results of the parameter optimization for tire stiffness in two models: Brush and Gain-Saturation, both of which are based on the reference model (Pacejka).

Please ensure that all the files in the repository are available before running the script.
